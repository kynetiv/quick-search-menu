# Quick Search Menu - Chrome Extension

## Summary

Do you highlight, copy and paste into a search bar often? Sure you do!
With a little help from Quick Search Menu you can configure multiple "quick searches" from the extensions options page, which will then become available as right click options.

For example, say I wanted to search Google for the some text I've Highlighted:

![Configure Quick Search Items](./img/configure-quick-search-menu.png)

After adding the item, we can easily highlight text on the page and search google with our selection:

![Right-click context-menu showing user created search options](./img/right-click-quick-search-menu.png)
